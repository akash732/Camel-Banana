# Camel-Banana

Let’s see what we can infer from the question:

•	We have a total of 3000 bananas.
•	The destination is 1000KMs
•	Only 1 mode of transport.
•	Camel can carry a maximum of 1000 banana at a time.
•	Camel eats a banana every km it travels.
With all these points, we can say that person won’t be able to transfer any banana to the destination as the camel is going to eat all the banana on its way to the destination.

But the trick here is to have intermediate drop points, then, the camel can make several short trips in between. 

Also, we try to maintain the number of bananas at each point to be multiple of 1000.

Let’s have 2 drop points in between the source and destination.

With 3000 bananas at the source. 2000 at a first intermediate point and 1000 at 2nd intermediate point.
